# dotfiles

Nord themed keyboard-driven minimalist developer environment with the [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) window manager. Hacked together with python and bash scripts inspired from [Qtile examples](https://github.com/qtile/qtile-examples).

The included scripts expect this repo to be cloned at `~` (resulting in `~/dotfiles/`).

## Requirements

- Neovim
  - node, yum
- 
- i3 (pretty much default, use my Qtile config instead)
  - `i3 i3status i3lock`
- Qtile
  - `feh alacritty picom (jonaburg) rofi`
	- AUR: `picom (jonaburg) nerd-fonts-fira-code oh-my-zsh`
